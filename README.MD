# Riffusion extension for AUTOMATIC1111 Web UI

## Installation

Clone this repo inside your `/extensions` folder

## Usage

Select the `Riffusion MP3 Generator` script before generating, and use the riffusion model.

## TODO
- Currently does not do the fancy img2img latent space interpolation described by the authors, just generates .mp3 files each time you generate an image

## Troubleshooting
### FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2]
You are most likely missing ffmpeg
